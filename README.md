# Kickstarting with Excel
Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign  

## Overview and Purpose
After Louise's play came close to its fundraising goal, she is now curious how her play "Fever" fared in comparison to other plays and if there are specific variables or trends that lead campaigns to become more successful than others such as launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 

First, we started off by sorting our data by theater outcomes by launch dates. We did this by using the =YEAR function based on the date the dataset was created. After finding they're dates created and date ended we then create a pivot table by having the filters be parent category (theater) and years, our outcomes in the column section, and rows as date created conversion and finally "count of outcomes" in the values section. This table now shows us Theater outcomes based on launch dates over a years time.

After, we created a line chart to help visualize the percentage rate of successful , failed , and canceled kickstarters over a one year period of time.

From this chart we can see that the month of May had the highest success rate while also having the highest rate of failure.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
